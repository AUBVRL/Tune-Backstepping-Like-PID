# Tune-Backstepping-Like-PID
Some MATLAB scripts that show the similarity between the backstepping and the PID gains, and help tune a backstepping control law in a similar way to PID tuning.

(to repository is under construction)

# Methodology
The backstepping nonlinear control design for second-order can be formulated as a PID-Feedback + Feedforward tems. The PID gains are related to the backstepping gains through the following relation:

kp = 1 + k1 x k2, <br />
kd = k1 + k2, <br />
ki = gamma k1. <br />
